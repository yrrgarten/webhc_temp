# AI Governance – Innovation with Responsibility

Artificial Intelligence offers enormous potential but brings new risks. With an AI Management System according to ISO 42001 and EU AI Act compliance, you can use AI technologies safely and responsibly.

## The AI Compliance Challenge

AI systems are different from traditional software:
- **Unpredictability** through machine learning
- **Bias and discrimination** from training data
- **Explainability** is often limited
- **Legal risks** from EU AI Act and emerging regulations

## What is ISO 42001?

ISO 42001 is the first international standard for AI management systems. It helps organizations:
- Systematically identify and control AI risks
- Ensure responsible AI development and use
- Achieve compliance with upcoming AI legislation
- Build stakeholder trust through transparent AI governance

## Your AI Challenges

### Developing Your Own AI Systems
- How do I ensure my AI is fair and transparent?
- What data can I use for training?
- How do I document AI decisions?
- What testing and validation is required?

### Procuring and Integrating AI
- How do I evaluate AI vendors and their systems?
- What contracts and SLAs do I need?
- How do I safely integrate external AI into my processes?
- What due diligence is required for AI suppliers?

### Compliance and Risk Management
- Am I affected by the EU AI Act?
- How do I identify high-risk AI systems?
- What documentation is required?
- How do I manage algorithmic accountability?

## My Approach

### 1. AI Landscape Assessment
- Inventory all AI systems in your organization
- Classification according to risk levels (EU AI Act)
- Assessment of current governance structures
- Identification of compliance gaps

### 2. Risk Evaluation
- Identification of AI-specific risks
- Assessment of bias, fairness, and transparency
- Analysis of privacy and security aspects
- Evaluation of algorithmic impact

### 3. Governance Framework Development
- Define roles and responsibilities
- Establish AI policies and processes
- Integration with existing compliance structures
- Cross-functional AI governance committee

### 4. Monitoring and Control
- Continuous monitoring of AI performance
- Incident management for AI systems
- Regular audits and reviews
- Algorithmic accountability measures

## EU AI Act Compliance

The EU AI Act comes into force in stages:
- **February 2025**: Ban on certain AI practices
- **August 2025**: Requirements for high-risk AI systems
- **August 2026**: Full application

**High-Risk AI Systems** must among other things:
- Carry CE marking
- Provide comprehensive documentation
- Ensure human oversight
- Conduct regular monitoring
- Maintain audit trails

## International AI Governance

### US AI Governance Landscape
- **Executive Order on AI** (October 2023)
- **NIST AI Risk Management Framework**
- **State-level AI regulations** (emerging)
- **Sectoral AI requirements** (finance, healthcare)

### Cross-Border AI Compliance
- Navigating multiple regulatory frameworks
- International data flows for AI training
- Global AI supply chain management
- Cross-border incident response

## Industry-Specific Applications

### Software Companies
- AI-powered product features
- Responsible AI development practices
- Customer AI transparency requirements
- Third-party AI integration governance

### Financial Services
- Algorithmic trading systems
- AI-driven lending decisions
- Fraud detection systems

- User notification requirements
- Audit trail maintenance

### Human Oversight and Control
- Human-in-the-loop systems
- Override and intervention capabilities
- Accountability chain definition
- Decision review processes

## Your Benefits

- **Future-proofing** through early EU AI Act compliance
- **Trust building** with customers and stakeholders
- **Risk minimization** in AI projects
- **Competitive advantage** through responsible AI use
- **Integration** with existing ISMS structures
- **Global compliance** across multiple jurisdictions
