# Practical Information Security – With a Business Perspective

Hello, I'm Arne and I help companies systematically and practically build their information security.

## My Journey

**20 years of IT experience** have shown me: the best security strategy is useless if it doesn't work in day-to-day operations. As **COO of a German-American software startup for 7 years**, I personally experienced the compliance challenges that growing companies face.

This operational leadership experience sets me apart from many other consultants: I know the reality between business pressure, limited resources, and increasing compliance requirements from first-hand experience.

## What Drives Me

I've always been fascinated by **IT, technology, and business**. This combination allows me to think through information security not just technically, but also from a business perspective.

Compliance is not an end in itself – it must serve business success and be practically implementable.

## My Qualifications

- **ISMS Security Officer according to ISO 27001**
- **CCSK (Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge) Version 4**
- International experience through work in Germany and the USA
- Track record: Successfully led several ISMS projects to certification

## My Approach

**Pragmatic instead of dogmatic** – Every company is different. Standards like ISO 27001 provide the framework, but the concrete implementation must fit your company culture and processes.

**Results-oriented** – In the end, what matters is not perfect documentation, but that your information security actually works and is measurably improved.

**Partnership-based** – I work with you, not for you. Your team should ultimately be able to work independently with the ISMS.

## My Clients

From **startups with 10 employees** to **companies with over 1 billion euros in revenue** – I have accompanied companies of various sizes in their ISMS projects.

This range allows me to understand both the challenges of rapidly growing startups and the complexity of established mid-market companies.

## International Perspective

My experience in both German and American business environments gives me unique insights into:
- **Cross-border compliance requirements** (GDPR, CCPA, SOX)
- **Cultural differences** in security approaches
- **International standards implementation**
- **Global supply chain security**

This international perspective is particularly valuable for:
- German companies with US operations
- American companies expanding to Europe
- Startups targeting global markets
- Companies dealing with cross-border data flows

## Why Remote and On-Site?

In today's world, much is possible remotely – workshops, reviews, document creation. At the same time, some things are simply more effective on-site: getting a feel for the company culture, team discussions, visiting the workplace.

I find the right mix for each project.

## My Mission

Information security should not be a necessary evil, but an **enabler for secure growth**. If, after implementing your ISMS, you are not only compliant but also operationally better positioned, I have done my job right.

The combination of German thoroughness and American pragmatism – that's what my international clients value most.
